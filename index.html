            <p>Game development is one of the most exciting fields of computer science and a major part of the software
                development industry. Computer games comprise of a large and ever expanding market world-wide.</p>
            <p>
                Interactive digital media and games along with entertainment applications have an enormous craze amongst
                the
                daily users of PCs and play an important role in providing economical strength(as games are not free), a
                factor which cannot be easily neglected.</p>
            <p>
                So game development will also continue giving birth to new ideas and interactive devices for making the
                game
                play more attractive and exciting. For this game developers need to be well trained and equipped with
                their
                development skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                An important characteristic of game development is that learners and developers should come up with new
                ideas and a catchy plot, leave the rest on this course, as by the end of this tutorial you will have the
                specific skills required for game development. It has been observed in Germany that the country gave
                rise to
                facilities to willing learners to develop games by establishing game academies in every location of
                Germany
                that focuses on specific training related to game development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, Studytonight is offering readers a free opportunity to setup your own academy to learn at your own
                pace and develop games based on your own ideas and skills.</p>

            <header>How to develop a Good Game?</header>


            <p>Becoming a good Game developer needs a lot of practice, working on your ideas and a step by step
                approach.
            <p>

                First step, is to come up with a plan/blueprint of the game. Games that doesn't follow proper
                development
                methodologies suffer from issues like:
            </p>
            <p>
                Time taken for development is more.
                Runs over budget.
                Tends to be unreasonably more buggy.
                So, an advice for the new game developers, before proceeding with designing and coding the game, mend a
                clear goal and figure out what your game needs. This phase of game development is called Requirement
                capture</p>
            <p>
                or Planning phase. You can also use formalized languages like Unified Modeling Language (UML), (which we
                will discuss in details in our later chapter). In the "Requirement capture" or "planning phase", game
                developers can use case diagrams, for quickly collecting the insights about the requirements (e.g. how
                many</p>
            <p>
                designers, coders, testers required or developing tools needed - Game Engine, Animation tools and other
                modeling tools along with the game play or story line or objectives and levels of game) to effectively
                manage and successfully complete your game development.</p>

                void update()
                <br>
                {
                    <br>
                    starBody.velocity() = new Vector2(Input.GetAxisRaw("Horizontal")*speed, Input.GetAxisRaw("Vertical")*2);

            <p>There are certain challenges which your developing team will have to face (if you are not developing
                games alone). Some of the issues which you or the team members may face are:

            <p>Every day new features and tools are released online and your team members will have to manage and
                upgrade their skills.</p>
            There may be internal dispute or personal issues which your team manager should tactfully manage.
            Good tester(s) should have to be hired to make your game bug-free or else your game may not achieve the
            considerable popularity or even meet your set target.<p>
                So for that the project manager should choose proper and skilled designers, developers and testers to
                make the team work with coordination.</p>

            <p>The steps and stages required for a game's development follow similar stages like that of software
                development, along with a few extra stages for successful completion of the game. Since game development
                is a major part of the software development industry, therefore game development also goes through the
                various phases of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) along with some extra phases. Let's explain
                these phases in details.
            <p>

                Software Development Life Cycle is a well-structured and arranged sequence of phases in software
                engineering for developing the intended software product. Same structure needs to be followed by a game
                developer also. These stages are:</p>

                <code>

                <li>


                    <p> Here, the user initiates the request to develop a desired game. Then he/she contacts the
                        developer or project managing firm and tries to discuss the terms. Then after a successful
                        agreement, stage 2 will begin. If the user himself is a hame developer, then it starts from
                        stage 2 directly.</p>

                    <header> Requirement Gathering: </header>
                    <p> In this stage, the game development team discusses the requirements to carry on the project
                        and
                        the project manager will decide the number of human resources required for the project. The team
                        will carry out the discussion with varied stakeholders to discuss problems with various domains
                        with a motive to bring out as much information as possible based on their requirements.</p>

                        software engineering models in next chapter, in details) appropriate for the project. This phase
                        also includes a proper understanding of the product's limitations or changes required in

                        animations in game, business rules, process diagrams (UML, DFD), pseudo-code and other

                        month. This is done officially by the team itself to check for errors and popularity. With this
                        partial release of game, the promotion is also started on websites like YouTube and other gaming
                        sites. At the same time tester(s) are hired to check for bugs in the game.</p>

                        the levels at ease. Also mods (modifiers) are also released after 6-10 months of game release,
                        which are also patches that updates the game to add additional features and functionalities
                        (adding new bikes or inserting new model of guns).</p>
